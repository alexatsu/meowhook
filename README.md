## 🩸 who we are

MeowHook is a Discord familiar — a soft-furred daemon in your server’s shadows.  
We open doors to secret voice realms, whisper the weather outside, and count the hours you’ve been lingering in the digital ether.

We are:

* 🖤 watchers of the voice void
* 🕷 channel conjurers with `/createvc`
* ☁️ weather-witches reading API skies
* 🩶 archivists of your profile lore

---

## ⚔️ what we make

* 🦴 voice channels that spawn from nothing
* 🌡 temperature spells that fetch the now
* 🕶 personal profiles that reveal your voice-time story
* ⏱ trackers that remember your hours, your longest stay, your patterns

---

## 💻 commands

* `/createvc` — conjure a fresh voice channel
* `/temperature <city>` — feel the weather beyond the glass
* `/profile` — reveal your full voice and activity profile:
    - total hours in voice channels
    - longest session
    - last active date
    - other personal stats
* `/leaderboard` — find your place among the talkers
